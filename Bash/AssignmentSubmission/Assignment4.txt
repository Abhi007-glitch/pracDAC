1.Develop a shell script to print the username, current date & time, and current directory.
#! /bin/bash


echo "Current User name is $(whoami) "
echo "Today is $(date "+%d-%m-%Y") "

echo "Current Directory is :  $(pwd)"


2.Write a shell script to print sum of all digit of a given number.For e.g. If no is 123, sum of all its digit will be 1+2+3 = 6
#! /bin/bash 

read -p "Enter the number for which sum of digit has to be calculated : " num


sum=0

while [[ $num -gt 0 ]]
do
	let sum=sum+num%10
	let num=num/10
done

echo "Sum of all digits is : $sum "

3.Develop a shell script to compare three numbers and print the largest. Give the numbers from the
command line.
#!  /bin/bash

read -p "Enter three numbers among which greatest has to be find : " num1 num2 num3


greatest=num1

if [[ $greatest -lt $num2 ]];
then
     greatest=$num2
fi

if [[ $greatest -lt $num3 ]];
then 
	greatest=$num3
fi

echo "The Greatest number is $greatest "



7.Write a shell script called calculator using case structure, which takes arguments from command
line eg., 2+3, 2*3 etc. and displays the result. It should perform the following operations:
a.Addition
b.Subtraction
c.Multiplication
d.Division
#! /bin/bash 


function add
{
  let sum=$1+$2
  echo "Sum = $sum"
}


function subtract
{
  let sum=$1-$2
  echo "diffrence = $sum"
}

function multiply
{
  let mul=$1*$2
 echo "Product = $mul"

}

function divide
{
 let div=$1/$2
 echo "Division result = $div"

}



bool=true

while $bool 
do
	read -p "Enter two number on which mathematical operation has to be performed : " num1 num2
	echo " Enter Id of Operation that you want to perform on inputed values"
	echo " a. addition "
	echo " b. substraction "
	echo " c. Multiplication "
	echo " d. Division "

	read option

	case $option in
		a) add $num1 $num2
			;;
		b) subtract $num1 $num2
			;;
		c) multiply $num1 $num2
			;;
		d) divide $num1 $num2
			;;
		*) exit ;;
		
	esac

done




13.Write script to print given number in reverse order, for eg. If no is 123 it must print as 321
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number: "
read no

reversed=0

while [ $no -gt 0 ]
do
	digit=$((no%10))
	reversed=$((reversed*10+digit))
	no=$((no/10))
done

echo "The number in reversed order is : $reversed"


14.Write script to print nos as 5,4,3,2,1 using while loop
#!/bin/bash

no=5

while [ $no -ge 1 ]
do
	echo $no
	no=$((no-1))
done


15.Write script to find out factorial for a given no
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number: "
read number

factz=1

for (( i=1;i<=number;i++))
do
	factz=$((factz*i))
done

echo "Factorial of $number is $factz"
